dbt Labs is making changes to the Discovery API. These changes will take effect on August 15, 2023. 

The model by environment object is being deprecated and will be replaced with `environment { applied { modelHistoricalRuns } }`. When the time comes, you will need to update your API calls accordingly to avoid errors. Refer to the 
[Environment object schema](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/discovery-schema-environment) for details.

### Example Query

You can use the `environment_id` and `model_unique_id` to return the model and its execution time for the last 20 times it was run, regardless of which job ran it.


```graphql
query{
  modelByEnvironment(environmentId: 834, uniqueId: "model.marketing.customers", lastRunCount: 20) {
    runId, # Get historical results for a particular model
    runGeneratedAt,
    executionTime, # View build time across runs
    status,
    tests { name, status, executeCompletedAt } # View test results across runs
  }
}
```
